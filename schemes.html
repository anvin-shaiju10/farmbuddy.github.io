                <h3>Mango plantation: A reminder of how NREGA can tremendously contribute to rural development
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) is often seen as another 
                    name for digging holes. This view is unfair, since NREGA supports a wide variety of projects
                    . It also overlooks the fact that some holes are quite useful. Wells and ponds are two examples.
                     A careful evaluation of NREGA wells in Jharkhand by the Institute for Human Development (IHD),
                      published in 2016, found that they were very productive.
        
        Another example is a hole where you plant a mango tree. Digg .
