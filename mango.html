        <p style="padding-left: 1cm;padding-right:1cm;color:rgb(16, 78, 16)">Mango is very well adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. It thrives well in almost all the regions
            of the country from sea level to an altitude of 600 m. The ideal temperature range for mango is <b> 24-30 Degree Celcius</b>
            during the growing season, along with high humidity. A rainfall range of 890-1,015 mm in a year is
            considered as ideal for growing mangoes. However, mango can be grown in regions of both heavy
            (2540 mm) or scanty (254 mm) rainfall. Dry weather before blossoming is conducive to profuse
            flowering. Rain during flowering is detrimental to the crop as it interferes with pollination.
            Fog, cloudy weather at the time of flowering from November to February results in poor setting of fruits
            and favours pest and disease incidence. Mango grows well on wide variety of soils, such as lateritic,
            alluvial, sandy loam and sandy.The loamy, alluvial, well-drained, aerated and deep soils (2-2.5 m) rich
            in organic matter with a pH range of 5.5-7.5 are ideal for mango cultivation. The water table should be
            around 3 m and soils with high water table are unsuitable for mango.Mango (Mangifera indica) is the leading fruit crop of India and considered to be the king of fruits.
            Besides delicious taste, excellent flavour and attractive fragrance, it is rich in vitamin A&C. The tree
            is hardy in nature, can be grown in a variety of soil and requires comparatively low maintenance
            costs. Mango fruit is utilised at all stages of its development both in its immature and mature state.
            Raw fruits are used for making chutney, pickles and juices. The ripe fruits besides being used for
            desert are also utilised for preparing several products like squashes, syrups, nectars, jams and jellies.
            The mango kernel also contains 8-10 percent good quality fat which can be used for soap and also as a
            substitute for cocoa butter in confectionery. </p>

        <h4> Soil and climate of a ecosystem are the important factors which determine about success or failure of mango crop.</h4>

   <li><h4>While planning a mango orchard atmost importance should be given to take soil sample and its analysis for pH. nutrient status, EC, water soluble salt content etc</li></h4>
   <li><h4>Similarly with respect to climatic conditions temperature, rainfall, wind, hailstorms and altitude of the given place should be considered especially in the selection of a variety.</li>
